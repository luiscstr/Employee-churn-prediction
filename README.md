# PROBLEM STATEMENT 
Hiring and retaining employees require capital, time and skills. In the US, firms face an average churn of about 10%-15%, and this churn can prove costly. It is estimated that an unwanted departure of an employee can cost the firm anywhere from 30% (of his/her annual salary) for more junior employees to 400% for much more senior employees. The difficulty of finding a replacement and bringing that replacement to the same level of productivity, the lost knowledge and know-how, and the period where resources have to carry the extra load of a missing colleague can be serious problems, especially for firms that face a higher rate of attrition.

Understanding the reasons and anticipating when an employee is most likely to leave could lead to take preventive actions and planning new hirings in advance, reducing the costs above mentioned. To do so, HR has collected extensive historical data on their employees, such as job satisfaction, performance rating, work like balance... HR is also providing a variable (attrition) that indicates if the employee left the company or not.
