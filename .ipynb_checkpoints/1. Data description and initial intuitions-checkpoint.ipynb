    "Before proceding with the analysis itself, we can make some supositions based just on our judgment, and try to identify which variables contribute to reduce the attrition and which ones increase it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Variables that we expect to reduce the employee attrition:\n",
    "\n",
    "- 'HourlyRate','DailyRate', 'MonthlyIncome', 'MonthlyRate': for all this salary related variables, we can expect the employees with higher salaries to have a lower rate of attrition.\n",
    "- 'PercentSalaryHike': those employees that have speculate had a salary increase probably present a lower rate of attrition\n",
    "- 'TotalWorkingYears': Usually, mobility among employeers less working years who are starting their careers tends to be higher\n",
    "-'EnvironmentSatisfaction', 'WorkLifeBalance','JobSatisfaction', 'JobInvolvement','RelationshipSatisfaction': All this variables looks like straighforward. The higher the satisfaction with working conditions, the lesser the reason to leave the company.\n",
    "- 'PerformanceRating': Seems reasonable to expect that those employees with higher performance rating usually stay ath the company.\n",
    "- 'JobLevel': Probably more senior workers present a lower rate of attrition.\n",
    "- 'StockOptionLevel': Employees with this benefit will tend to stay more in the company.\n",
    "- 'TrainingTimesLastYear': This variable means that the company is investing in their employees. Possibily employees with more trainings are more satisfied and tend to stay longer.\n",
    "- 'YearsAtCompany','YearsInCurrentRole': employees with more years at the company probably will have less rate of attrition. Years in current role can actually go both ways. Longer time in a role could mean that the employee is satisfied with his/her current role. On the other side, could mean that there is no possibility for a promotion.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Variables that we expect to increase the employee attrition:\n",
    "\n",
    "- 'NumCompaniesWorked': An employeer that has a high number of companies work for means that usually changes his/her job.\n",
    "- 'DistanceFromHome': The longer distance the worst commute, which might impact the satisfaction, work life balance.\n",
    "- 'OverTime': No need to comment this one, right?\n",
    "- 'YearsSinceLastPromotion': longer takes to get a promotion, higher attrition.\n",
    "- 'BusinessTravel': probably those emmployees that travel more frequently have a higher level of attrition."
